# Summary/Abstract

*Cyanobacteria are a diverse group of Gram-negative oxygen-evolving photoautotrophic prokaryotes which play an important role in biological nitrogen fixation. These prokaryotes produce two kinds of metabolites: primary metabolites which are essential for survival and secondary metabolites which are required for auxiliary purposes--stress responses, defense mechanisms, metal carrying, and signaling. These secondary metabolites can include compounds that act as hormones, antibiotics, allelochemicals and toxins which is important because antibiotic resistance in bacteria and fungi is becoming a problem due to resistant pathogenic bacteria. Both species of cyanobacteria used in this experiment belong to a Genera with known toxin, antibiotic, and/or fungi producing species. Thus we aim to expand upon this work by investigating these newly identified species and their production of secondary metabolites. Specifically, we aim to 1) identify both novel cyanobacteria by doing whole genome sequencing and creating phylogenetic trees based on known conserved regions as well as 16s phylogenetic trees, 2) investigate secondary metabolites by annotating the genome sequenced, 3) test the reactivity of the antimicrobial and/or antifungal compounds produced by the cyanobacteria against Gram-Positive bacteria, Gram-Negative bacteria, and a fungal species, and to evaluate the potential toxicity of both species using an Artemia salina bioassay.*

# Introduction

## General Background Information

*Starting from Project 1, I used the Palmer Penguin dataset [@manual:2020] and cleaned it using Rstudio. This project--Project 2--aims to answer questions based on the clean data, again using Rstudio to make graphs and plots to help visualize the data.*

## Description of data and data source

*Novel species was discovered from Big Ell Cave located on Kilauea, Hawaii in 2008. Mutliple samples were taken from 2008 - 2018 in order to get an idea of the effects of a volcanic eruption on the biodiversity within the caldera. Samples were isolated to obtain what we are calling JS1 (Gleobacter violaceus), JS2 (Fischerella sp), and JS3 (Leptolygnbya sp).*

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

*Aims of this project include to address the following:*

-   1.Are these unknown cyanobacteria novel Species, Genera, or Family?\*

-   2.Do these novel cyanobacteria--Leptolyngbya sp. and Fischerella sp.--produce any toxic secondary metabolites or any that inhibit the survival of another organism?\*

-   3.If these species produce any toxic or inhibitory secondary metabolites, are they novel?\*

# Methods

\*After extracting the DNA, Illumina and MinION sequencing was done in the Advanced Studies in Genomics, Proteomics, and Bioinformatics (ASGPB) located at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Life Science Building 320. Genomic data for all available Fischerella species were obtained from National Center for Biotechnologu Information (NCBI). Genomes were annotated using Ulana, a Prokka pipeline written by Ethan Hill of Iolani High School. Using Rstudio, the annotations were cleaned and organized to extract the annotated genes of interest. Genes for the rpoB, rpoC, rpoC2,cbbL, and cbbS genes were extracted from the genome and aligned using MUSCLE 3.8.

## Data acquisition, import and cleaning

\*Data was obtained from field samples of a mat found in a volcanic calderea on Hawai'i. DNA was extracted and sequenced at the facilities located at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. The whole genome was annotated and cleaned and can be found under /Data/Raw_Data_JS2/JS2_genome/JS2_MinION_only_20_contigs(1).fasta.

#Cleaning script

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("Processingcode.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
# or sys.source("your-script.R", envir = knitr::knit_global())
```

*Data was uploaded, checked for errors, and then organized to extract the data of interest. Comparison between each species was made in terms of what genes each species shared between each other as well as what genes were shared between all species.*

#Anaylsis script

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("Anaylsis_Code.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
# or sys.source("your-script.R", envir = knitr::knit_global())

Difference between the sex of Gentoo penguins.

```{r}

Difference between the sex of Chinstrap penguins.

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/C_BM.png")
```

The Gentoo penguin seem to have a higher body mass, culmen length, and flipper length when compare to the Adelie and Chinstrap.When looking at the culmen length and culmen depth, the Adelie have a lower culmen length but a higher culmen depth than both the Chinstrap and Gentoo(@fig-species_comparison).

knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Island_CLvFL.png")
```

## Further analyses

Based on the graphs created, there were some interesting points that would be worth looking further into. The body mass on Biscoe was higher than that of Dream Island and Torgersen.It would be interesting to look into this and identify if this was due to a certain species of penguins being more abundant on this island. We should also take into account the size of the island and the distance between all three islands. Similarly, it is noted that there was not an equal amount of each three species sampled in the original dataset which might skew the data in favor of one species over another.

Following the first idea, we noticed that the Gentoo Penguins have higher body mass than the other two species and noticed that Biscoe Island had the most amount of penguins sampled while Torgersen had the least amount sampled from. It would be interesting to look into the diet of the penguins since there was also a difference in culmen depth, culmen length, and flipper length between the penguins.

Finally, to ensure that there is a significant difference, we can actually perform an anova for these questions to identify if there is a difference. This would give us a statistical value which would help support our figures above.

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

For this project, the cleaned data was taken and analyzed using Rstudio to make graphs and plots to help visualize the data. Three questions were posed at the beginning, 1. Is there a difference between the sex of penguins, 2. Are there really three groups of penguins--Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap, and 3. Is there an difference between the islands? For all three questions, all continuous data was used to help analyze the data. Bar plots and comparative scatter plots were made to help visual data to help answer our questions.

## Strengths and Limitations

This analysis looked at all the data presented to get an overall visual of the data to answer these questions. Further analysis should be done to better support these findings and more data is needed to help balance the species and island comparisons as they were not sampled from equally and having more data points in one over the other two might greatly skew the results.

## Conclusions

To summarize, we found that 1. There is a difference between the sex of penguins, and more specifically, there is a difference between sex of all three species of penguins individually--with males having higher values in body mass, culmen length, culmen depth, and flipper length. 2. There are three distinct species of penguins based off the dataset, with Gentoo and Adelie having features that stick out, such as higher body mass and flipper length or higher culmen depth. 3. There is a difference between the islands as Biscoe Island had higher body mass than the other two. Dream Island also had a wider range of culmmen length when compared to Torgersen Island and Biscoe Island.
